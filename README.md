# Villager Pickup

Allows you to pickup villagers into spawn eggs by **shift right clicking** on one. 

The villager spawn egg will retain all nbt data of the previous villager meaning he stays exactly the same as before you picked him up

### Compatibility
Because of the way that this mod is coded it **works with all modded villagers** by default if they are not a separate entity (for example you cant pick up wandering traders) but this can be easily changed with a very small amount of coding knowledge

The mod is **fully server side** and vanilla clients can use it when its installed on the server side
